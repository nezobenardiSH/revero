 # Table Reservation Platform - Project Summary

## Project Understanding
**Core Problem:** Our company offers POS, QR ordering, CRM, memberships, and online ordering to restaurants but lacks a table reservation platform - a critical gap in our restaurant solution ecosystem that merchants need for complete operations management.

**Target Users:** 
- Primary: Existing merchant clients who need reservation capabilities to complement their current tech stack
- Secondary: Restaurant diners booking at specific restaurants through white-labeled merchant-specific platforms

**Solution Approach:** Build a white-label reservation platform where each merchant gets their own branded booking site (e.g., storeA.revero.com), deeply integrated with our existing ecosystem (POS, CRM, membership, QR ordering), leveraging unified data for AI-powered personalization that standalone reservation platforms can't offer (AI will be in future development)

**Key User Journey:** 
1. User chooses guest booking or membership signup (with welcome rewards)
2. Selects branch, date, time, pax count, special occasion
4. Views and selects actual table photos
5. Receives confirmation email
6. Can edit/reschedule until 24hrs before (auto-locks after)

**Success Looks Like:** 
- Higher membership conversion through reservation incentives
- Seamless POS integration for pre-orders
- 24hr advance notice for restaurant preparation
- Reduced no-shows through membership accountability
- Clear table selection reducing customer dissatisfaction

**Technical Direction:** 
- Web-based platform (browser notifications required)
- Integration-ready architecture for existing membership system
- POS system integration for automatic pre-order inclusion
- Email notification system
- Image management for table photos
- Automated booking status changes (lock at 24hrs)

**First Version Focus (MVP - Customer-Facing Only):** 
- White-label platform with merchant-specific subdomains (storeA.revero.com)
- Single restaurant support (expand to multi-branch later)
- Guest + membership signup options with welcome rewards
- Select date, time, pax count
- Table photo display with placeholders
- Email confirmations
- Edit/cancel functionality (24hr before)
- Integration with existing membership system
- Pay-at-restaurant model (POS handles payment)
- Basic API to send reservation data to merchant systems


**Future Development (Post-MVP):**
1. **Pre-order System:** 
   - Special occasion detection and item mapping
   - Pre-order items from restaurant menu (birthday cakes, etc.)
   - Auto-sync pre-orders to POS
   - 24hr auto-lock for pre-order preparation
2. **Merchant-Facing Platform:** 
   - Real-time browser notifications with sound/visual alerts
   - Table management and photo uploads
   - Occasion-item configuration
   - Reservation analytics dashboard
3. **Advanced Integrations:**
   - POS: Auto-sync as open tabs, real-time table status
   - QR Ordering: Recognize reservation when guests scan
   - CRM: Build dining preference profiles
   - Online Ordering: Convert fully-booked times to takeaway
   - Unified customer journey tracking
4. **Enhanced Features:**
   - Multi-branch support
   - Waitlist management
   - Smart table recommendations based on party size/preferences
   - Automated special date reminders (anniversaries, birthdays)

**AI-Powered Smart Features (Post-MVP):**
- **Personalized Upselling:** "Add your favorite appetizer (Spring Rolls) to your reservation?" based on POS order history
- **Win-back Campaigns:** "It's been 30 days since your last visit - here's 10% off your next booking"
- **Guest Preferences:** Remember and auto-suggest dietary preferences and table choice from past visits
- **Regular Recognition:** Identify returning guests and personalize their experience
